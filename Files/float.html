                    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
                    And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.
                    Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
                    And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
                    And every fair from fair sometime declines,
                    By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;
                    But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
                    Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st.

                    I have seen roses damask’d, red and white,
                    But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
                    And in some perfumes is there more delight
                    Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
                    I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
                    That music hath a far more pleasing sound.
