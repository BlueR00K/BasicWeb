                    In Stratford’s town, a quill began to dance,
                    And shaped the soul of English eloquence.

                    No stage too grand, no passion left unsaid,
                    He gave us life in every word he made.
                    From Romeo's sigh to Macbeth's haunted mind,
                    The breadth of man in verse he did enshrine.
                    Though centuries pass, his lines still brightly burn,
                    A timeless voice from whom all dramatists learn.
                    The Globe may fall, yet still his spirit sings—
                    The world’s own Bard on everlasting wings.
